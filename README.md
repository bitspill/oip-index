## Getting Started

### Getting an Artifact_DEPRECATED from the Index

To get an Artifact_DEPRECATED back from the Index, we will first need to spawn a new `Index` object. This `Index` object is what we will interact with in order to get Artifacts back from the Index.  After you have created a new `Index` you can lookup a specific Artifact_DEPRECATED using the [`.getArtifact(artifact_id)` method](https://oipwg.github.io/oip-index/Index_.html#getArtifact). The `getArtifact` method returns a Promise that will resolve to the requested [Artifact_DEPRECATED](https://oipwg.github.io/oip-index/Artifact_DEPRECATED.html), or will reject if there was an error.

```javascript
import { Index } from 'oip-index'

var index = new Index()

index.getArtifact("513691").then((artifact) => {
    console.log(artifact.getTitle())
})
```

### Use a Custom OIPd Server

Using a custom OIPd server as your source for Artifacts is simple, yet powerful. To hookup to an OIPd server, simply pass the API url into the Index object when you create it. All requests made to the `index` object it creates will use the OIPd server you specified as its source of truth.
```javascript
import { Index } from 'oip-index'

var index = new Index("https://my-oipd-url.com/api")
```

### Create a new Artifact_DEPRECATED

Creating a new Artifact_DEPRECATED allows you to build your own Artifact_DEPRECATED that can then be handed off to `oip-account` for publishing to the Index. To create a new Artifact_DEPRECATED, we first need to import the Artifact_DEPRECATED class from `oip-index`. After we have imported the class, we can then create a new Artifact_DEPRECATED.

```javascript
import { Artifact_DEPRECATED } from 'oip-index'

var myArtifact = new Artifact_DEPRECATED();
```

After we have created our new Artifact_DEPRECATED, we can then start setting values on it, as well as adding files. In this example, I am just going to set the Title, and Description.

```javascript
myArtifact.setTitle("My Great Title")
myArtifact.setDescription("The description for the Artifact_DEPRECATED we are creating")
```
